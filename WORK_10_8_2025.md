# Work Items - October 8, 2025

## Project Repository
Git repo: [https://github.com/sudheer-akkio/dbt-vizio-poc.git](https://github.com/sudheer-akkio/dbt-vizio-poc.git)

- Review all documentation in repo README(s) if there are questions on the pipeline

---

## 1. Validation Required from Vizio Team - Experian Spine

### 1.1 Duplicate Hash Entries & Data Granularity
**Issue:** There are duplicate hash entries in the Experian data, with varying values in demographic fields (non-binary fields).

**Question for Vizio:** 
- Does this mean each hash is at the **household level**? 
- Please confirm the granularity of the hash identifier.

### 1.2 Match Date Column for Deduplication
**Issue:** Due to the duplicated hashes, we need a way to identify the most recent/valid entry.

**Question for Vizio:**
- Is there a `match_date` column available? (This was originally included in the Experian spine data dictionary)
- If a `match_date` column exists, can it be provided in the data source?
- With a `match_date`, we can implement deduplication logic based on the most recent hash entry.

---

## 2. Pipeline Updates - Deduplication Logic

**Task:** Update `v_akkio_attributes_latest.sql` with new deduplication logic

**Actions:**
- Implement new dedup logic in the attributes model
- Rerun the pipeline for:
  - `v_akkio_attributes_latest`
  - `v_agg_akkio_hh`
  - `v_agg_akkio_ind`

**Command:**
```bash
dbt run --select v_akkio_attributes_latest v_agg_akkio_hh v_agg_akkio_ind
```

## 3. Audience Development

**Status:** 
- ‚úÖ MTC / Dashboard builder - Currently working
- üîÑ Audience tool - In progress

**Task:**
- Get audience functionality working
- Additional pipelining can be added to the dbt repo as needed


| Task | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|

## 4. Data Isolation & Client Instances

**Task:** Determine from Vizio team if seperate clients are needed for Nothing Bundt Cakes, and Farm Bureau Financial Services (right now they all fold into one client).

**Actions:**
- Create 2 new schemas, each for the clients listed above and move the relevant performance tables into each client schema
- Create shared 'akkio_common' schema with all ACR + Spine datasets and generate the appropriate views itno each client schema (same data model we currently use)
- On application side, setup client, configure datasource, etc...

---

## 5. Environment Validation & Tuning

**Task:** Validate and test the environment
